# Flight Simulation
## ECE 163 UAV Modeling and Controls

This code repository contains project code for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Modeling and Controls course
at UC Santa Cruz.

The labs follow lessons learned from the textbook, *Small Unmanned Aircraft Theory and Practice
by Randal W. beard, Timothy W. McLain*:

- **Chapter2.py** - Allows the students to test their coordinate frame transformations 
- **Chapter3.py** - Kinematic Simulation (object subjected to forces in a vacuum environment)
- **Chapter4.py** - Adds in Aerodynamics and Gravitational forces to the simulation 
- **Chapter5.py** - Finds trim conditions and the ideal trim path for any fixed spiral
- **Chapter6.py** - Takes linearized model and closes the loop using successive loop closure
